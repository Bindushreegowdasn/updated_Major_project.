# Medicinal Plant Classification by Visual Characteristics Using CNN 🌿

## 📌 Project Overview
Medicinal plants are widely used in traditional and modern medicine. Accurate identification of these plants is essential, yet manual identification requires botanical expertise and is time-consuming.

This project presents an **automated medicinal plant classification system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** based on **visual characteristics of plant leaves** such as shape, texture, and color.  
Additionally, the project integrates an **AI chatbot powered by Ollama**, enabling users to interactively query plant-related information, medicinal uses, and classification results.
